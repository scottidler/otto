I want to write my own DAG (dependencies) driven make-list task executing program in Rust. Should I use thread parallelism or process parallelism?

It depends on the specific requirements of your task execution program and the trade-offs you are willing to make. Both thread parallelism and process parallelism have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Thread parallelism allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process, sharing the same memory space. This makes it easier to share data between threads, but it also means that a problem with one thread can potentially affect the entire process. Threads are also generally lighter weight than processes, so they can be created and destroyed more quickly.

Process parallelism involves creating separate processes that run concurrently. Each process has its own memory space, so it is more isolated from other processes and less likely to be affected by problems in other processes. However, it can be more expensive to create and communicate between processes, as the processes do not share memory and must use inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms to exchange data.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to use thread or process parallelism will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your task execution program. If you need to share a lot of data between tasks, or if the tasks are relatively independent and do not need to communicate with each other frequently, then thread parallelism may be a good choice. On the other hand, if the tasks need to be highly isolated from each other or if you need to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, then process parallelism may be a better fit.

Can you show some  code and highlight required libraries for an implementation in Rust?

Sure! Here is an example of how you could implement a task execution program in Rust using thread parallelism:

use std::collections::{HashMap, VecDeque};
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

struct Task {
    dependencies: Vec<String>,
    command: String,
}

struct TaskExecutor {
    tasks: HashMap<String, Task>,
    ready_tasks: VecDeque<String>,
}

impl TaskExecutor {
    fn new(tasks: HashMap<String, Task>) -> Self {
        let mut ready_tasks = VecDeque::new();
        for (name, task) in &tasks {
            if task.dependencies.is_empty() {
                ready_tasks.push_back(name.to_string());
            }
        }
        Self { tasks, ready_tasks }
    }

    fn run(&mut self) {
        let ready_tasks = Arc::new(Mutex::new(self.ready_tasks.clone()));
        let tasks = Arc::new(Mutex::new(self.tasks.clone()));

        let mut threads = vec![];
        for _ in 0..num_cpus::get() {
            let ready_tasks = ready_tasks.clone();
            let tasks = tasks.clone();
            threads.push(thread::spawn(move || {
                while let Ok(task_name) = ready_tasks.lock().unwrap().pop_front() {
                    let task = tasks.lock().unwrap().get(&task_name).unwrap();
                    // execute task
                    for dependency in &task.dependencies {
                        let mut dependencies = tasks.lock().unwrap();
                        let dependency = dependencies.get_mut(dependency).unwrap();
                        dependency.dependencies.retain(|x| x != &task_name);
                        if dependency.dependencies.is_empty() {
                            ready_tasks.lock().unwrap().push_back(dependency.name.to_string());
                        }
                    }
                }
            }));
        }

        for thread in threads {
            thread.join().unwrap();
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let tasks = vec![
        (
            "task1".to_string(),
            Task {
                dependencies: vec!["task2".to_string(), "task3".to_string()],
                command: "echo task1".to_string(),
            },
        ),
        (
            "task2".to_string(),
            Task {
                dependencies: vec!["task4".to_string()],
                command: "echo task2".to_string(),
            },
        ),
        (
            "task3".to_string(),
            Task {
                dependencies: vec!["task4".to_string()],
                command: "echo task3".to_string(),
            },
        ),
        (
            "task4".to_string(),
            Task {
                dependencies: vec![],
                command: "echo task4".to_string(),
            },
        ),
    ]
    .into_iter()
    .collect();

    let mut execut

Sure! Here is the rest of the code example:

    let mut executor = TaskExecutor::new(tasks);
    executor.run();
}

To implement this example, you will need to use the following libraries:

    std::collections::{HashMap, VecDeque}: These libraries provide data structures for storing the tasks and their dependencies, as well as a queue for storing the ready tasks.

    std::sync::{Arc, Mutex}: These libraries provide thread-safe data structures and synchronization primitives for sharing data between threads.

    std::thread: This library provides tools for creating and managing threads.

    num_cpus: This crate provides a function for determining the number of CPU cores on the current system.

To use these libraries, you will need to add the following to your Cargo.toml file:

[dependencies]
num_cpus = "1.12"

Then, you can include the libraries in your code by adding the following to the top of your file:

use std::collections::{HashMap, VecDeque};
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;
use num_cpus;

Can you show the code on how I setup the DAG and the coding libraries to use so that I can determine which tasks can be run in parallel and which need to wait on successful completion of a dependency?

Sure! Here is an example of how you could set up a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks in Rust and use it to determine which tasks can be run in parallel:

use std::collections::{HashMap, VecDeque};

struct Task {
    name: String,
    dependencies: Vec<String>,
    command: String,
}

struct DAG {
    tasks: HashMap<String, Task>,
}

impl DAG {
    fn new(tasks: Vec<Task>) -> Self {
        let tasks = tasks
            .into_iter()
            .map(|task| (task.name.clone(), task))
            .collect();
        Self { tasks }
    }

    fn ready_tasks(&self) -> Vec<&Task> {
        self.tasks
            .values()
            .filter(|task| task.dependencies.is_empty())
            .collect()
    }

    fn run_task(&mut self, task_name: &str) {
        // execute task
        let task = self.tasks.get_mut(task_name).unwrap();
        for dependency in &task.dependencies {
            let dependency = self.tasks.get_mut(dependency).unwrap();
            dependency.dependencies.retain(|x| x != &task_name);
            if dependency.dependencies.is_empty() {
                self.ready_tasks.push(dependency);
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let tasks = vec![
        Task {
            name: "task1".to_string(),
            dependencies: vec!["task2".to_string(), "task3".to_string()],
            command: "echo task1".to_string(),
        },
        Task {
            name: "task2".to_string(),
            dependencies: vec!["task4".to_string()],
            command: "echo task2".to_string(),
        },
        Task {
            name: "task3".to_string(),
            dependencies: vec!["task4".to_string()],
            command: "echo task3".to_string(),
        },
        Task {
            name: "task4".to_string(),
            dependencies: vec![],
            command: "echo task4".to_string(),
        },
    ];

    let mut dag = DAG::new(tasks);
    while let Some(task) = dag.ready_tasks().pop() {
        dag.run_task(&task.name);
    }
}

In this example, the DAG struct stores a mapping of task names to Task objects, which represent the tasks in the DAG. The ready_tasks method returns a list of tasks that have no remaining dependencies and are ready to be run. The run_task method executes a task and updates the dependencies of other tasks as necessary.

To determine which tasks can be run in parallel, you can use a thread pool or a similar mechanism to execute the tasks concurrently. For example, you could use the std::thread library to create a pool of worker threads that execute tasks as they become ready.

are you familiar with the rust create, daggy? If so could you rewrite the code using that library?

Yes, I am familiar with the daggy crate. daggy is a library for working with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in Rust. Here is an example of how you could use daggy to implement a task execution program in Rust:

use daggy::{Dag, NodeIndex};
use std::collections::VecDeque;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

struct Task {
    command: String,
}

struct TaskExecutor {
    dag: Dag<Task>,
    ready_tasks: VecDeque<NodeIndex>,
}

impl TaskExecutor {
    fn new(dag: Dag<Task>) -> Self {
        let mut ready_tasks = VecDeque::new();
        for node in dag.externals(daggy::Direction::Incoming) {
            ready_tasks.push_back(node);
        }
        Self { dag, ready_tasks }
    }

    fn run(&mut self) {
        let ready_tasks = Arc::new(Mutex::new(self.ready_tasks.clone()));
        let dag = Arc::new(Mutex::new(self.dag.clone()));

        let mut threads = vec![];
        for _ in 0..num_cpus::get() {
            let ready_tasks = ready_tasks.clone();
            let dag = dag.clone();
            threads.push(thread::spawn(move || {
                while let Ok(task_index) = ready_tasks.lock().unwrap().pop_front() {
                    let task = dag.lock().unwrap()[task_index].weight;
                    // execute task
                    for child in dag.lock().unwrap().children(task_index) {
                        let mut dependencies = dag.lock().unwrap();
                        let child = dependencies.node_weight_mut(child).unwrap();
                        child.dependencies.retain(|x| x != &task_index);
                        if child.dependencies.is_empty() {
                            ready_tasks.lock().unwrap().push_back(child);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }));
        }

        for thread in threads {
            thread.join().unwrap();
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut dag = Dag::new();
    let task1 = dag.add_node(Task {
        command: "echo task1".to_string(),
    });
    let task2 = dag.add_node(Task {
        command: "echo task2".to_string(),
    });
    let task3 = dag.add_node(Task {
        command: "echo task3".to_string(),
    });
    let task4 = dag.add_node(Task {
        command: "echo task4".to_string(),
    });
    dag.add_edge(task2, task1, ());
    dag.add_edge(task3, task1, ());
    dag.add_edge(task4, task2, ());
    dag.add_edge(task4, task3, ());

    let mut executor = TaskExecutor::new(dag);

Sure! Here is the rest of the code example:

    executor.run();
}

To use the daggy crate in your code, you will need to add the following to your Cargo.toml file:

[dependencies]
daggy = "0.22"

Then, you can include the library in your code by adding the following to the top of your file:

use daggy::{Dag, NodeIndex};

daggy provides a Dag type for storing directed acyclic graphs, and a NodeIndex type for representing nodes in the graph. You can use these types to create and manipulate a DAG of tasks in your program.
